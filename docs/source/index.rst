1. Introduction to Wireless Printing
-----------------------------------

Wireless printers connect to your network using Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for USB cables. Once connected, any device on the same network (like your PC, laptop, or smartphone) can access the printer. This makes wireless printers ideal for home and office environments where convenience and flexibility are important.
